# Comments

* Non-documentation comments are strongly encouraged.

* C-style comments (`/* */`) and standard C++ comments (`//`) are both fine. However, single-line comments should opt for `//`, while multi-line comments should opt for `/* */`.

* For readability, add a single space after `//` style comments, and an extra space immediately inside both ends of a `/* */`-style comment.
