# Comments

* Non-documentation comments are strongly encouraged. A general rule of thumb is that if you look at a section of code and think "Wow, I don't want to try and describe that", you need to comment it before you forget how it works.

* C-style comments (`/* */`) and standard C++ comments (`//`) are both fine.

* For readability, add a single space after `//` style comments, and an extra space immediately inside both ends of a `/* */`-style comment.
