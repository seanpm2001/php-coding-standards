# Personal PHP Coding Standards

This guide is an attempt to precisely and thoroughly document all of the idiosyncrasies around how I write PHP code, focusing primarily on style, and a little on structure.

There are a couple of places where I deviate from PSR-2, but those exceptions are documented along with my rationale for rejecting that section of the PSR recommendation.

My primary influences are [SimplePie](http://simplepie.org), [AWS SDK for PHP](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php), [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).
