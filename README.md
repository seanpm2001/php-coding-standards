# Parman PHP Coding Standards

This guide is an attempt to precisely and thoroughly document all of the idiosyncrasies around how I write PHP code, focusing primarily on style, and a little on structure.

There are a couple of places where I deviate from PSR-2, but those exceptions are documented along with my rationale for rejecting that section of the PSR recommendation.

## Disclaimer

This is an attempt to document my personal coding style, patterns, and rationale. This is NOT an attempt to tell anybody else how to write code. There is a 100% chance that someone will disagree with me, and that's perfectly OK. This is for me.

If you want to fork this and make edits for yourself or your team, please go right ahead.

## Influences
My primary influences are:

* [SimplePie](http://simplepie.org)
* [AWS SDK for PHP](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php)
* [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/)
* [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)
* [Evolt](http://evolt.org/node/60247/) standards
* ...and other things I've picked up since I started writing PHP in 2002.

## Obsoletes
This set of standards cannibalizes and obsoletes the document I published back in 2010. This set is more evolution than revolution, and there is still a lot of overlap between the two.
