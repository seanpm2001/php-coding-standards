# Personal PHP Coding Standards

This guide is an attempt to precisely and thoroughly document all of the idiosyncrasies around how I write PHP code, focusing primarily on style, and a little on structure.

There are a couple of places where I deviate from PSR-2, but those exceptions are documented along with my rationale for rejecting that section of the PSR recommendation.

## Sections

* [PSR.md](PSR.md)
* [EDITOR-SETTINGS.md](EDITOR-SETTINGS.md)
* [GRAMMAR.md](GRAMMAR.md)
* [COMMENTS.md](COMMENTS.md)
* [SPELLING.md](SPELLING.md)
* [NAMING.md](NAMING.md)
* [WHITESPACE-ALIGNMENT.md](WHITESPACE-ALIGNMENT.md)
* [CLASSES-METHODS.md](CLASSES-METHODS.md)
* [LANGUAGE-PATTERNS.md](LANGUAGE-PATTERNS.md)

## Influences
My primary influences are:

* [SimplePie](http://simplepie.org)
* [AWS SDK for PHP](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php)
* [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/)
* [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)
* [Evolt](http://evolt.org/node/60247/) standards
* ...and other things I've picked up since I started writing PHP in 2002.

## Obsoletes
This set of standards cannibalizes and obsoletes the document I published back in 2010. This set is more evolution than revolution, and there is still a lot of overlap between the two.
